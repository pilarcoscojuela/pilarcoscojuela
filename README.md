- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pilar
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in post-quantum cryptography, computational algebra, discrete mathematics, algebraic geometry. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about algebraic cryptanalysis, that is, designing attacks to cryptographic primitives that involves to solve a system of multivariate equations. Moreover, I'm reading Algebraic Number Theory by I.
to introduce myself in number theory
